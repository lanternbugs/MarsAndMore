IN Cancer, Mars is in his fall; but Cancer is so receptive a sign that influent is not antagonistic. In fact, it makes the martial energy subtle and profound, dissolving it,  as it were, and thus making it more active, just as a solution of phenol is more corrosive than the crystals themselves.
Some of the greatest artists that have ever lived have this position of Mars; it seems as if the specialized energy which he represents were somehow made universal. There is not that same concentration upon a single line that is shown for example, by Mars in Aries; there have been found very few instances of politicians or conquerors or even great generals with this position.
