IN Pisces Mars reaches the very depths of misfortune. The sign is watery, receptive, sensitive, psychic, the very antithesis of the fiery, dominant, brutal, material planet. Very few people with this detrimental position, unless strongly aspected, reach any remarkable goal;*,even the greatest men are so hampered in their external expression that their greatness passes unremarked in a world that can only be conquered by battle-axes and sledge-hammers.
