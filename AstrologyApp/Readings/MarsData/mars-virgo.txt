MARS and Mercury are not altogether unfriendly, and certainly Virgo has no such detrimental effect on Mars as we found exerted by Gemini, but the combination is a little cold-blooded. There is a certain passionate chastity about it; real warmth of heart in the conventional sense appears to be denied. It will be seen that, of all upon our list, though many are great men and women, not one can be called a great lover. This remark applies as much to method as in the preceding sections; it refers to a certain coldness and detachment of action, as if the enthusiasms were not awakened. Yet the will may be extremely strong.
