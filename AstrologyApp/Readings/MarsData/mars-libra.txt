IN Libra, Mars is in his detriment; but he is not so weak as might appear from this first consideration. Libra rather tempers his activity with judgment; and, if he be well dignified, he may be as strong here as anywhere. He becomes more effective through being more controlled. But, in every case we examine, we shall find an excellent quality of direction given to him; just as the explosive force of gunpowder gains in effectiveness by virtue of the very limitation of the barrel of the rifle.
Sadi Carnot, for instance, was by no means so ambitious as Cromwell, who had Mars in Aries; but he did not need to use the same violence. His method was admirably adjusted to circumstances, and he attained his ends without recourse to undue force. He measured his actions carefully, and there was no lack of power, but at the same time no excess.
