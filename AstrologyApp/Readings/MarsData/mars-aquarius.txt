THE Uranian and airy influence of Aquarius tends to cause Mars to spend his energy more in the direction of intellectual force and we may add, moral force. The method will be expansive, free, open, and yet full of wisdom. There are, of course, unfortunate exceptions. If over-excited by some dangerous aspect, the airy formula may be as distracting as that given by Gemini.
Mary, Queen of Scots, suffered from this airy temperament in her mode of action, for, though the Sun was sextile, Saturn was square, and Uranus in opposition.
Aquarius, on the whole, gives far more freedom of action to Mars than does Capricorn; hence occasionally we find looseness in its method, and, in all cases, the native is more a man of thought than of action.
