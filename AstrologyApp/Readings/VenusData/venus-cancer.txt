VENUS IN CANCER 
ONE might generalize the effect of the elemental attribution of the signs upon Venus by calling fire passionate, earth affectionate, air ideal or romantic, and water voluptuous. The passivity of Cancer certainly makes Venus extremely emotional. It is hard for a person with this position to resist the advances of another; at the same time, the lunar force in Cancer makes the nature changeable. There is little disposition to seek companionship or love, but, when these are offered, they are gladly accepted. There is often deep sentimentality, and the native is apt to take his affairs too seriously ; in reality, wounds heal quickly. It is very unfortunate for any native with this position to be deprived of free normal expression of his or her tendencies; in such cases the health may suffer. 
This sign is in many ways the most suitable of all for Venus; she seems to dissolve into a swoon therein. However, the tendency is to sensuality in a very marked degree, though not so much so as we shall find when we come to Scorpio. It is desirable to find some aspect with a tendency to correct any exaggeration of this quality. The desire for comfort in life and general good fortune in minor matters is to be expected in natives with Venus in Cancer. In art and music, and in literature also, the effect appears to be very intense; the feelings are very quiet and deep-seated, permeating the whole atmosphere. This quality will be recognized in the work of Dante, Balzac, and Schumann. The peculiar pathos and melancholy of the last-mentioned is, of course, due to the conjunction of the Lord of the Ascendant, Saturn, with Neptune. In all these determinations it must constantly be remembered that one practically never finds any single uncomplicated aspect; and crude, superficial research is consequently bound to be misleading.
