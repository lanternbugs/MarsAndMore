THIS sign brings out the colder and more earthy side of Venus, and exercises a restricting influence, in many cases, upon the temperament. While it gives strong and permanent attachments, yet the nature may be called capricious. The native loves the comic or Panic de of intrigue; he is likely to be somewhat gross and even lustful in the expression of attachment; he will waste time, health and money in the search for pleasure; yet at the same time he will be extremely petty about it. There is little amiability. Indifference is the real interior attitude. And this is only modified by gusts of storm. The native is usually jealous and exacting. He expects too much of other people; but that not through optimism or idealism, but, on the contrary, from self interest. 
People with Venus thus situated are usually very slow in developing the sexual instinct, and the later they marry the better their chances to make a success of it. Sometimes this tardiness is such that it never develops at all during the life time. This is often the case when other instincts happen to be tremendously powerful. We find many instances of people whose human side has failed to develop through the occupation of the mind with loftier ideals. We may notice the cases of William Blake, Swami Vivekenanda, Joseph Smith and Jeanne d'Arc, all of whom were occupied primarily with mystic conceptions. In the case of the Indian sage Venus took her revenge, as she nearly always does when slighted, and that which might have been after all quite as holy as any amount of meditation 
expressed itself in ways which nearly led to open scandal.â€¨
