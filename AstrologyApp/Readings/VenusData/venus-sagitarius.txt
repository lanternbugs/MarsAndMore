VENUS IN SAGITTARIUS is in some ways at her best in this sign. She has not the passion which we have noticed in the other two fiery signs. She is more impulsive and less constant. The slightest rebuff kills the interest. And in no case is affection likely to be long-lived. These remarks apply to love rather than to friendship, for, in the latter, the fact that Jupiter rules Sagittarius comes into play. 
For this reason we call Venus at her best; she has an aspiring and spiritual quality which tends to remove from her any taint of earthy grossness. This very quality, however, may in some eyes appear as a defect. Those who imagine that the only kind of love is that which is expressed in accordance with social conventions may be un- measured in the hatred of such tendencies as this sign confers, particularly upon women.  
It is very common to find fantastic passions such as have been celebrated by Baudelaire, Verlaine and Swinburne, as well as by the one supreme poetess that ever lived, Sappho. Those things which are 
gross and unrefined do not appeal. It is necessary to satisfy mental and spiritual cravings and also to content the imagination. The lack of earthiness, the absence of physical bonds, causes rapid changes which may be mistaken for caprice, bu which are really not so; on the contrary, they are symptoms of fidelity to the ideal. People with this position are proud and high-spirited, and they demand the same qualities in those whom they love. Indelicacy shocks. Further it may be said that any attempt to bind down the affections is intensely resented. To fish for such people one must employ the finest lines and the smallest flies ; though the more brightly they are colored, the more successful is likely to be the sport.
