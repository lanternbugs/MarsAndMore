This app is my first astro app, though i've made other apps, and the program's code is Open Source.  I had some prior astro programming experience with a bot on Internet Relay Chat. I'm a Capricorn born 12-28-70 around sunrise in Southern California. Some of this app evolved from discussions on IRC and Discord astro servers.  Special thanks to Tim who wrote the Discord Astrobot for making me think about how to make the transit finder faster by reducing ephemeris calls and leading me to astro fonts for the chart wheels. I had been looking for images.

If interested, leave a rating or review on the App Store or feel free to reach out via the email on the App Store Support page(lanternbugs at gmail). Bug reports can go to support mail too. Please consider at least a rating if a regular user. It's the only way the app gets noticed.
