Mars & Astrology and More's development is paused, and I hope everyone enjoys the program.  I am now working on a professional astrology product with more features, charts and customization. This will not affect Mars and More, and the free level of service here will continue to be offered. The App can still be updated as I can continue to do tweaks, bug fixes, maintenance etc, but for the moment it is feature complete.

I started app development at the end of December in 2009 with my first chess app, Lantern Chess.  Over the years I added more chess apps and now have 4 in the App Store. and the original Lantern Chess, a desktop app on a web page, lanternchess.com. I also started working as a professional app developer in this period. 12 years later, about one rotation of Jupiter, I started Mars and More, this time in January 2022.  I wanted to move on to a new area of programming in my personal apps. Something in lifestyle not games.  I had some prior astro programming experience with a bot.
