I hope everyone enjoys this program.  Its author is a Capricorn born 12-28-70 around sunrise in California. This app is my first astro app started originally for a resume item demonstrating Swift and SwiftUI and the program's code is Open Source.  Some of this app evolved from discussions on Internet Relay Chat and Discord astro servers.  Special thanks to Tim who wrote the Discord Astrobot for making me think about how to make the transit finder faster by reducing ephemeris calls and leading me to astro fonts for the chart wheels. I had been looking for images.

I started app development at the end of December in 2009 with my first chess app, Lantern Chess.  Over the years I added more chess apps and now have 4 in the App Store. and the original Lantern Chess, a desktop app on a web page, lanternchess.com. I also started working as a professional app developer in this period. 12 years later, about one rotation of Jupiter, I started Mars and More, this time in January 2022. I had some prior astro programming experience with a bot. I wanted to move on to a new area of programming in my personal apps. Something in lifestyle not games.

It can be fun when the discussion about an app is two ways, both the author and users.  If interested, leave a rating or review on the App Store or feel free to reach out via the email on the App Store Support page.
