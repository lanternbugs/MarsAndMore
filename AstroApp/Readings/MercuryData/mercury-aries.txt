In Aries, Mercury is strong and impetuous. The native is usually a creature of impulse, taking up ideas with enthusiasm but unable to concentrate upon them for any length of time. He is often witty, inventive, vigorous in execution, a capable administrator or governor, though apt to be dictatorial and impatient of opposition, and still more so of delay. He is liable to fits of passion, and when Mercury is afflicted, especially by Uranus, he may be subject to persistent and acute headache, neuralgia, and in bad cases, intermittent mania or epilepsy.

But where Mercury is well dignified, this position is altogether admirable for sheer brilliance of mind. Shakespeare, Zola, Sir Richard Burton, J. M.W Turner, Tchaikovsky, Daudet, Kant and Swinburne all had their Mercury in Aries. In military affairs we find General Grant, and in the modern world of finance, J. P. Morgan.! One may also remark on the fact that Marguerite Steinheil was similarly favored, and collate it with what has been said elsewhere with regard to her career.
