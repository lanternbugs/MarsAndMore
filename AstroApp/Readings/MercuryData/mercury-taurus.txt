In Taurus, Mercury is the very antithesis of himself in Aries. The mind of the native is slow, patient, solid and constructive, and often obstinate. He may have a great intellect, but often may learn more from travel and experience than from books. There is however frequently some tendency to mental inertia, and this nearly always expresses itself as conservatism. Such minds resist new ideas. Consider Queen Victoria, the most successful reactionary of the 19th century. She came to a throne already tottering beneath the blows of the French Revolution and of such thinkers as Shelley, and she smothered Republicanism by "fighting the fight of sit-down" until at her Jubilee she was more firmly seated than any Tudor!

Huxley too, for all his brilliancy and originality, was in some ways as conservative as his queen. In science he never jumped at conclusions; he was perhaps the most cautious and profound thinker, both in science and in philosophy, that England had produced. Similar qualities, not so well dignified, are visible in General Boulanger and George V In them there is some hanging back noticeable; hesitation just where dash was wanted! For constructive obstinacy in politics we should look rather to Cromwell, who was of course a far more absolute monarch than the weak king whom he replaced.

When Mercury in Taurus is constructive, he is very constructive indeed, as is exemplified by Wagner and Balzac.

There is never any doubt about the solidity and worth of the intellect of people with this position; how it may work out to advantage or disadvantage depends almost entirely upon the aspects.
