In Gemini, Mercury is in his own house, but although quite as strong as one would expect, it is his airy changeful side that is most accentuated. There is danger of over- development of the mind at the expense of the vital forces, of living too wholly on the mental plane, of restlessness and anxiety and overwork, which errors may culminate in nervous breakdown. III aspects of Neptune, the Moon and Uranus confirm this threat.

The minds of such people are often singularly lucid, but intellectually rather than instinctively or intuitively. They rationalize admirably, but nearly always neglect more important considerations. Their logical processes are perfect, but they are apt to generalize from insufficient data, or to omit some cardinal fact in their premisses. They are often therefore regarded as silly, though never as stupid. Their superficial rapidity of mind often makes them good public speakers or journalists, for rapidity is an essential mental qualification in these professions, and their facility in logical process without rigid insistence upon precedent fact makes them successful lawyers.

They possess great versatility-often too much, sometimes lacking steadiness and application. They are easily influenced by their environment; a slight matter starts them off on a new trail. Where the hearing is good they make fine linguists, but unless Mercury is fortified by good aspects of the heavier planets, not especially adapted for any of the deeper modes of thought. Albrecht Durer and Dante are the greatest names upon our list, and in both cases Mercury is greatly steadied and helped by Saturn and Uranus. In the second rank we find George Sand, Thomas Hardy and Bulwer-Lytton. Richard Strauss, whose Mercury is in the last degree of Taurus and therefore blends the influences of both signs, may perhaps be worthy of the first-class. But more characteristic of Gemini is the coldly intellectual quality of mind shown by George III, Robespierre, Brigham Young, Jay Gould and Abbas Effendi. There is something colorless and bloodless about the manner of thought of all these people which puts them in a class apart. Yet more typical of the purely mental and superficial character of this position ofMercury is George Bidder, the "Lightning Calculator." 1 The mind in such a case is as merely a machine as if it were made of metal, and this is the essentially mental quality, and the occasion of St. Paul's remark, "the carnal mind is enmity against God".
