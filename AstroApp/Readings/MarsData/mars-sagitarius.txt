WE have already had occasion to note the transitory nature of the sudden action of Sagittarius. The symbol of the arrow was chosen to express that curious quality. In the case of a heavy and slow moving planet, the action will be, perhaps, to quicken it to some extent; but with Mars, which is already fast and fiery, there is no such compensating influence. Mars tends to become meteoric when in this sign. Unless the energy be carried on for a reasonably long period, it does not begin to have a fair chance to work. What can be done in a moment may be done exceedingly well; but works involving the element of time are likely to be failures. Our examples, therefore, will give us people scintillating rather than solid, dashing rather than enduring.
The swift brilliance of Oscar Wilde is to the point. He was incapable of large construction; his ideas were like shooting stars. Lewis Carroll has an identical limitation, and so had Rudyard Kipling, whose forte is short stories of extreme brilliance and who has written but two novels of any length, both of which are little more than a series of brilliant episodes.
