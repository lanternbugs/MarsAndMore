THE sign Gemini exercises upon Mars its usual influence; it transforms its potency to the mental plane, but it tends to disperse the force and to make it excitable and irritable rather than powerful.
Compare Thomas Hardy, whose Mars is in this position, with Dickens on the one hand and Daudet on the other, with Mars respectively in Aries and Taurus. Hardy's technique lacks alike brilliancy and softness ; it is not simple or direct, and yet it is far more intellectually developed than in either of the others. Mercury and the Sun in conjunction naturally tend to emphasize this point, and they are certainly of great assistance; without them the style would have been abrupt and obscure.
