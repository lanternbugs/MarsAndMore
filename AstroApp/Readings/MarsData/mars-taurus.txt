IN Taurus, Mars is in his detriment, and his fiery energy is largely transformed into obstinacy. The heaviness of Taurus weighs him down, and, though he fights with desperate courage, there is not that elan which we found him to possess in Aries. Nor is the Venusian character of the sign favorable to his full development; since, Taurus being earthy, it sometimes occurs that he is degraded to be cruel and callous. Yet, at his best, he is steady and earnest ; not so original, brilliant, nor lucky as when in Aries, nor so confident of the issue but dogged, and as the saying goes : "Dogged does it." We have examples of this in two of the most patient and persevering of those noble men who have given their lives to extend the empire of knowledge ; Sir Isaac Newton and Huxley. The latter, with the Sun in conjunction and Mercury very close, an exact trine of Uranus and a near one of Neptune, has an almost ideal Mars. He is in the eleventh house, showing the influence of the native working through friends and colleagues. Newton's Mars has sextiles of Jupiter and the Moon and a trine of the Sun within seven degrees ; and Uranus is very near the opposition. He was by no means a great fighter, like Huxley, as Mars is not so important in his nativity. Here we see only the patience and labor involved in his work, and the indomitable courage with which he attacked problems.
