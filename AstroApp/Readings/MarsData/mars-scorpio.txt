ALTHOUGH Mars is in his own house, he cannot be called strong for good. We have noticed that Aries did not bring out the highest qualities of Mars; Scorpio brings out his worst. Mars is the most unbalanced of the planets; the one most in need of restriction or direction. Almost any influence but his own touches his fire to rationality, generosity, or grace. But Scorpio, while in some ways the most powerful of the signs, may be described as snake-tempered; and in it he easily becomes bloodthirsty. It is even amusing to note how one of the gentlest spirits that ever dwelt within the human form, Robert Louis Stevenson, is often in method outrageous almost beyond the "penny dreadful." In "Treasure Island," cold-blooded murderers tumble over each other's heels, in circumstances of unparalleled atrocity. Who, without the help of Mars in Scorpio, could have invented Long John Silver, hopping after his comrade and braining him with his crutch, or the attempt, in "The Ebb- Tide," of Hurst to throw vitriol over Atwater, and the breaking of the bottle in his hand by the ready rifle of the pearler?
There is a complete lack of adaptability in this position of Mars ; it is sometimes replaced by treacherous cunning; but, as a general rule, the method of the native tends to be blind and brutal. Of course, the usual modifications caused by aspects are always to be considered.
