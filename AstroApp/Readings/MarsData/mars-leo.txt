WHERE the fire of Mars burns brightly, he obliterates minor distinctions. The Sun is, himself, fire ; in fact, Mars is but the fiery part of the Sun, so that Leo is as favorable to the development of Mars as even Aries ; indeed, more so. For the solar influence tends to balance, breadth, and fullest development in the fiery impulses ; Aries is, as it were, too martial to be the highest good for Mars.
We shall find as a rule, therefore, people with less passionate intensity of action, but with wider sympathies, than we found in Aries. Of course, in some cases Saturn's influence may override this; one cannot expect a person intensely narrow and selfish to act in accordance with sentiments better illustrated by Jupiter. Yet, all things considered, his method will be broader than had Mars been in Aries.
