THE cold and earthy and mercurial nature of Virgo may be described as the very opposite to that of Venus. The planet, too, is in her fall and never develops properly. She may make a woman a careful housewife and a good hostess for Virgo distributes the affections, forbids friendships but encourages acquaintanceships but never a loving wife or a passionate mistress, unless there are some remarkably warm aspects to intensify her nature. Women of the town, many of whom are incapable of true feeling of any kind, often have this position. The native, too, is usually fastidious about people. Others are inclined to consider him cold, heartless and repellent. On the other hand, the sang-froid and aplomb which his indifference gives often make him a favorite on the lecture plat- form or the stage. 
We find it, for example, in the horoscope of Marshall P. Wilder, the dwarf humorist. A very good example of its peculiar manifestation in art is the painter Millet. The perception is extraordinarily keen and accurate. 
We find little development of the emotional nature in this position. Some of the most notoriously cold and even callous people in history have possessed it. However, it does not always turn to evil, and, in many cases, the position is a decided advantage in life.
