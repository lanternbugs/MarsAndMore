VENUS IN GEMINI has the precisely opposite effect to Taurus. In this sign Venus is easily aroused, but has little or nothing physical or positive about it. It is inconstant, and always mental or ideal. People having this position of Venus are constitutionally, and -congenitaly-in-capable of understanding passion as ordinary men and women do. In the case of Shakespeare, for example, lie is a master of Neptunian love (Venus and Neptune are conjoined in his horoscope), as shown in "As You Like it" and "Twelfth Night" and "Midsummer Night's Dream, rather than of the ordinary passion between man and wife.
In Petrarch we have a somewhat warmer Venus, but the love is still ideal and therefore incomprehensible to the average man. One must be a poet to read Petrarch with pleasure. 
Where science is already elsewhere indicated as the pursuit in life, this position in Gemini comes naturally to strengthen that disposition, or at least to avoid weakening it by a counter-pull. Thus Kant, Huxley, and Herbert Spencer were undisturbed in their life's work by the claims of love or pleasure, and all their Venus-quality was manifested on the mental plane. 
People with this position are never quite satisfied. "Ah but a man's reach should exceed his grasp; or what's a heaven for?" is a Browning quotation which they import into private life. They are often frivolous, fickle, and incapable of any but the most superficial affection. Nor is the object of affection ever single; such people are often terribly puzzled as to which of several admirers to prefer. In truth, they want none of them; they like the titillation, and would be seriously annoyed if one of their pigeons turned out a hawk as sometimes happens! 
The intellectuality of Gemini often enables the native to understand passion, even though he does not feel it. The examples of Shakespeare and Petrarch given above are to the point.
