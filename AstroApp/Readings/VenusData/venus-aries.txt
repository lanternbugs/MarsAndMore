VENUS in this sign is in her fall, and the position is not fortunate, on the whole. There is evidence of the action of Mars in a certain  rash impulsiveness in emotion, but the effect is rarely lasting or deep even at the moment. There is a strong tendency to be what the French call cerebral, and also to what is really coldness, though it may manifest itself in fiery sparks. 
It is only necessary to study the writings of Baudelaire and Swinburne, to see the attitude taken towards love and art by both of them, to understand this position of Venus. There is fierceness and glitter, but it is the fire of the lightning rather than that of the hearth.
