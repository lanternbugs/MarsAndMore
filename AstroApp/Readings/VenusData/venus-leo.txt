VENUS IN LEO is by far the noblest of the signs and brings out the best qualities of Venus. Venus in Leo is not so passionate as in Aries, but she is loyal and warm-hearted. She becomes capable even of that highest virtue of self-sacrifice without which all is in vain. She becomes that Charity of which the apostle Paul waxed eloquent. This, however, depends as usual upon aspects; an attack of Saturn(for example) may undo all the good and transform it into evil; yet this is not so easily accomplished as when she is in a more passive and sensitive sign. However fallen, she always retains some memory of her ancient dignity. 
Thus we find many of the greatest-hearted people born with this position. Alexander of Greece is a fine instance, and so is Cicero, if we remember him as the author of De Senectute and De Amicitia. In more recent times we have Colonel Olcott, one of the kindest- hearted men that ever lived, Tolstoi, George Sand, and Maurice Maeterlinck. One will note the flavor of humanitarianism in its best sense in all these.
