In Gemini the stability of the Sun is greatly diminished. The first principle of all mechanical efficiency is the fulcrum; a rigid base is necessary for every machine. An enormous proportion of the power developed for locomotion is wasted in hammering out a permanent way. If therefore the Sun-which is the fulcrum of the bodily machine-is in a movable, airy, mercurial sign, the working power of the engine is seriously diminished.

IfWagner and Queen Victoria seem to be exceptions to this rule, it is because in their cases the Sun was still within a degree or two of Taurus, and partakes very largely of his nature. In these cases, too, it was well aspected.

Speaking generally, people with the Sun in Gemini show a certain vagueness and irresponsibility, finding it hard to concentrate upon any subject, or even to take any subject seriously. Even when their lives appear devoted to the prosecution ofa partic- ular object, it will seem as if there were no real basis in the nature corresponding to the observed effect. Their actions are prescribed by the mood of the moment, and they do things more because they are personally interested than with the idea of building up any important result for themselves. There is a great tendency to dissipate the force, and owing to the dual nature of Gemini, such people are always happier when leading a double life. This expression is not used in any equivocal sense; it merely means that they are happiest when they have more than one dominant inter- est. They cannot stay, according to the expression, with their "noses to the grind- stone." Permanent work makes them restless and uneasy in a very short space of time. "Variety is the spice of life" to them, and-especially when Venus and Mercury are both in the same sign-they often become "rolling stones," 'jacks-of-all-trades and
masters of none," unless there is some extremely stabilizing influence from a steady- going planet like Jupiter or Saturn, more especially Saturn. Thomas Moore is an excellent example of the lighter talents given by the Sun in this sign, and the versatil- ity ofBulwer-Lytton is also a manifest confirmation ofthis position.

Most of the force of the constitution and vitality of the native goes to nerve and intellect rather than to heart. We do not, as a rule, find people with warm Disposi- tions having this position of the Sun. Albrecht Durer, Bulwer-Lytton, Schumann, Strauss, are all examples ofthis. In the case ofJay Gould this coldness ofDisposition is even more marked.

Gemini rules not only the nerves but the ratiocinative part of the brain, as distin- guished from the executive, which is under Aries-the sensory as opposed to the motor function. It also rules the hands and arms, and in particular the lungs. The general sensitiveness of the nerves is however an excellent token of artistry. People with this position of the Sun are likely to hear more, to see more, than the average man. They are open to impressions, even the most delicate, and where Mercury assists, are able to record. them with exquisite fidelity. The intellectual qualities are, moreover, fine and strong. Their apprehension is based on knowledge; their memo- ries are excellent, and they build up splendidly on existing foundations. There is however not likely to be any tremendous force of originality in the mind unless Mer- cury holds aspects to Uranus or Neptune. The student will remark that even Dante was greatly indebted to Virgil on the one hand, and to the Patristic authors on the other.

Similarly, Wagner went entirely to existing tradition for his material, and a good third of the originality of his music is due to his exquisite sensibility in regard to sound, while his whole plan-particularly the cry of the leitmotif-is rationalistic and literary rather than musical.
It is part ofthe Gemini nature to demand a change ofscene and relaxation; exer- cise, sleep and fresh air are necessary to the health, which, however, will never be robust in the same way as we find it when the Sun is in such signs as Taurus and Leo. The native is really too high-strung, and unless things go his way he readily becomes depressed. It will be useless for him to endeavour to settle down in any fixed occupa- tion. The best he can do is to try to take advantage, as far as possible, of the qualities ofhis defects, and so to arrange his life that the sword does not too quickly wear out its scabbard.
