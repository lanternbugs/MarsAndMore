Aries is not at all sympathetic to the Moon, he being the most active, hot and fiery of the signs, and she the most passive, cold and watery of the planets. It gives great brilliancy, acuteness and susceptibility to the senses, but they are always on a terribly fine edge, so that extreme nervousness is likely to result. This may show itself in an extraordinarily quick temper, almost amounting to snappiness. Alexander VI, Henry VIII, Robespierre, Swinburne and Lord Northcliffe are all very good examples of this trait, which arose not from any fault of temper, or bad disposition in the ordinary sense, but from the intense overstrain upon them by the too-great activity of the nerves which communicated impressions.
In the case of women, where the life also is ruled by the Moon, we get an excel- lent example in George Sand. The directness and vividness of the sensations usually lead to great mental independence and activity; mental reaction takes place very rapidly.
It is very difficult for persons with this position to doubt the evidence of their
senses, and unless some other aspects tend to diminish the executive power or to
delay the operation of the judgment, the native will be so convinced as to the accuracy of whatever is presented to him that he will act immediately, without consideration. For the same reason, the native is apt to resent authority and to be disinclined
to listen to advice. There is a strong tendency to accept all ideas which are presented
to one as merely emotional and to leave them thus, as if the mind were naturally 2
attracted to Berkeleyan idealism. In consequence of this, and of the swift, almost automatic operation of action and reaction, the native is sometimes credited with originality, but this gift is often a defect, since it usually implies contradictions in thought arising from a lack of reflection and correlation of the various trains of thought. Thus, for example, we see Swinburne reading a paragraph in the newspapers about the wrongs of somebody in Russia and flashing into print with a violent son- net against the Tsar or perhaps against kings in general. In the same way, Henry VIII would dismiss a trusted minister, perhaps send him to the block, in what was little better than a fit of temper.
